<h4> Espresso </h4>
<p style="color:Maroon;"> A well balanced and flavorful shot of espresso requires a well trained barista and quality ingredients. If well prepared, it is naturally sweet and womderful. However, when badly brewed it propably ruins your day. </p>

<h4> Cappuccino </h4>
<p style="color:Maroon;"> Cappuccino is served everywhere. A good cappuchino is soft, creamy and served in cup not bigger than 2dl. You should be able to taste the coffee under the milk! </p>

<h4> Flat White </h4>
<p style="color:Maroon;"> Flat white is a newer addition to the family, but as you might suspect from the name - it should be flat. A big foam of milk does not belong in your cup of flat white. You also cannot get it black. Flat black isn't a thing.</p>

<h4> Caffe Latte </h4>
<p style="color:Maroon;"> Did you know that <i>latte</i> means <i>milk</i>? So if you order a <em>latte</em>, you are basically ordering milk without the coffee. But sure, most baristas understand what people mean with <em>latte</em>. You want the coffee as well.

<h3>Timetable for drinking coffee</h2>
<p>Italians have a routine when it comes to drinking cappuccinos:</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Should you drink cappuccino?</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Before 11am</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>After 11am</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
</table>
